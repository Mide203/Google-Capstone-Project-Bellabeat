Company: [Bellabeat](https://bellabeat.com/)

Author: Ayomide Onayemi

# STEP 1: ASK

**1.0 INTRODUCTION**

Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women.  has significantly impacted women's well-being by gathering data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health. Since its inception in 2013, Bellabeat has undergone remarkable growth, solidifying its position as a technology-driven wellness entity dedicated to women's health.

Key Stakeholders:

•	Urška Sršen (Co-founder and Chief Creative Officer)

•	Sando Mur (Co-founder and Mathematician)

•	Bellabeat Marketing Analytics Team

•	Consumers (Bellabeat Customers)

**1.1 BUSINESS TASK**

The objective is to analyze smart device data to gain insights into customer engagement with the Fitbit app. Leveraging trends identified through this analysis, high-level recommendations will be provided to inform Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

# STEP 2: PREPARE

**2.1 Data Source Used**

•	 [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data[(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic))

•	Generated by respondents from a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 12 March 2016 to 12 May 2016.

•	Content: Personal fitness tracker data from thirty Fitbit users, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Information covers daily activity, steps, and heart rate.

**2.2 Is the data ROCCC?**

ROCCC stands for Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited. 

Reliable - LOW – selection bias, this data was collected 7 years ago and probably does not effectively represent the current socio-economical factors.

Original - LOW – data is sourced through Amazon Mechanical Turk, a third-party platform, introducing potential biases and limitations.

Comprehensive - MEDIUM – while the dataset includes relevant parameters, the sample size of 30 respondents limits its comprehensiveness.

Current - LOW – The data is over 7 years old, potentially rendering the insights outdated and less applicable to the current landscape.

Cited - LOW - The data is collected from a third party, making the exact sources and methodology unclear and potentially introducing uncertainty.

# STEP 3: PROCESS

The file below was selected and used for analysis.

Data cleaning and manipulation with Excel.

1.	Download data and familiarize: The screenshot of the table below

2.	Sort Data by "ActivityDate", from oldest to newest

3.	Put data in a table and name "Bellafit"
  
4.	Check for blanks: =IF(SUM(COUNTBLANK(Bellafit))>0, "Blanks Found", "No Blanks")
   
5.	Distinct count of Id:  33 – contrary to the initially stated number of 30.
   
6.	Changed date format: mm/dd/yyyy to dd/mm/yyyy
    
7.	Extract "DayOfTheWeek" from ActivityDate: =TEXT(WEEKDAY([@ActivityDate]),"dddd")

8.	Calculate the TotalMinutes: =SUM([@VeryActiveMinutes],[@FairlyActiveMinutes],[@LightlyActiveMinutes],[@SedentaryMinutes])
9.	Calculate the TotalHours: =[@TotalMinutes]/60

# STEP 4: ANALYZE
The data cleaning and manipulation are done, next is the “analyze” phase. Data aggregation using pivot table.

**4.1 Findings from the analysis**

1. Tuesday is the most active day with the highest recorded number of steps and distance. Additionally, user engagement, indicated by the frequency of logins, reaches its peak on Tuesday.
  
2. Fitbit users, on average, recorded 7,638 steps and covered a distance of 5.49 km per week. Moreover, the average caloric expenditure amounted to 2,304 calories, with users spending an average of 20.3 hours engaging in activities throughout the week.

# STEP 5: SHARE

The column chart below shows peak user logins on Tuesdays, reflecting heightened engagement, while a significant drop from Friday to Monday suggests reduced app interaction over the weekend and the start of the workweek.

The scatter plot below shows the positive relationship between calories burnt and steps taken, with a correlation coefficient of 0.59. This means that as the number of steps increases, there is a corresponding rise in calories burned, highlighting the direct connection between physical activity and energy expenditure.

The plot below reveals a positive correlation (correlation coefficient: 0.644962) between calories burned and distance covered. This signifies that users covering greater distances exhibit higher calorie expenditure, emphasizing the direct association between physical activity distance and energy burnt.

The plot below reveals a positive relationship between calories burned and hours logged (correlation coefficient of 0.094951). This signifies a weak positive correlation, implying that there is a slight tendency for users who log more hours to burn more calories. 
A few outliers are also observed in the plot:

1.	Zero value outliers indicate an occurrence where neither calories burnt nor hours logged are recorded.
	
2.	Another outlier is noted at the 24-hour mark with a corresponding zero-calorie burnt. This outlier suggests a prolonged activity duration without any associated calorie expenditure.

The pie chart below provides valuable insights into Fitbits user activity:

•	Fitbit users predominantly log sedentary activities, indicating that a significant portion of their time involves low physical activity levels.

•	Users dedicate only a small portion of their time to monitor fitness activities, or they may not participate in physical activities like running or workouts.

•	Approximately 16% of users’ time is dedicated to light physical activities, showcasing a moderate engagement in activities involving mild exertion.

# STEP 6: ACT

**The trends identified:**

•	Notable day-specific peak indicates a recurring pattern of increased physical activity.

•	A higher percentage of Fitbit users engage in sedentary activities rather than utilizing the app for fitness tracking.

•	Users exhibit higher app engagement on weekdays compared to weekends.

**How can these inform Bellabeat marketing strategy?**

•	Bellabeat can capitalize on the observed weekday peaks by strategically deploying promotions, challenges, or content releases, particularly on Tuesdays.

•	Implement notification prompts to encourage users to engage in physical activity and track their activities using the app. Timely reminders can boost user adherence to fitness goals.

•	Develop educational content highlighting the importance of active living and the health benefits of regular exercise.
